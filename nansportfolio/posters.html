                  <h3>Miss Temptation</h3>
                  <h5>Personal Work, 2021</h5>
                  <p>People admire the beauty of models and actresses in the media, but the line between admiration and fetishization is precarious regarding Asian women. Asian women have been the subject of racially and sexually charged violence for centuries. The killing of 8 Asian women in Atlanta in March 2021, where the murderer claimed he was afflicted by a “sexual addiction,” drew new attention to the heartbreaking consequences of this fetishization. The past year has been complicated for Asian women who are under attack for their race, stereotypes around their culture, as well as their “tempting” beauty. This piece pulls together these aspects of this past year.</p>

                  <h3>Persimmon Perseverance</h3>
                  <h5>Personal Work, 2021</h5>
                  <p>For a long time, there has been resistance from Asian countries like India to provide girls with sanitary napkins as they're deemed "impure." As persimmons symbolize divinity in Japan, I desired to combat the negative connotation of talking about natural bodily necessities. Inspired by the Bollywood film "Padman," I learned about Arunachalam Muruganantham, who tried to revolutionize the manufacturing of sanitary napkins. I was surprised that something so ordinary in western society wasn't accepted in India, and I knew I wanted to depict the struggle.</p>

                  <h3>Not Your Basic Beti</h3>
                  <h5>Personal Work, 2021</h5>
                  <p>Traditionally, women have been idealized as objects to claim for men in Indian marriages. So I wanted to draw a modern Indian woman; then I laid a tikka to juxtapose traditional marriage expectations of Indian women and dowry. Seeing Indian women through a lens where they’re valued for domestic skills — cooking and cleaning, with preexisting dowry obligations is regressive. These expectations are unequal and this piece is an attempt to shed the retro lens of marital expectations in Indian culture as they harm women.</p>

                  <h3>I am yours</h3>
                  <h5>Personal Work, 2021</h5>
                  <p>Women were subjected to the painful process of foot binding during the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties. This practice was done to make women more “beautiful” and keep them off their feet to rely on their husbands. I originally wanted to show the dainty shoes worn by women whose feet had been bound but ultimately wanted to emphasize the horrific morph of the foot’s bone structure. Then, I wanted to juxtapose this against a bright, effeminate background to heighten the discomfort.</p>
